# Sample data

A place for a snapshot of DD4 server data for local development and testing.
You can copy the whole _server/area/_ directory in the main DD4 server repo here.

Makefile commands will look for area (`*.are`) files in the _sample-data/area/_ directory.
_area.lst_ and _MOBProgs/_ must also be located here.

The main parser will only attempt to parse areas in the _area.lst_ index file.
